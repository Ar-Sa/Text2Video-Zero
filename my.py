One sunny day, he challenged his friend Tilly the tortoise to a race. Confident he would win easily, Benny dashed ahead and decided to take a nap under a shady tree. Meanwhile, Tilly kept moving slowly but steadily. When Benny woke up, he saw Tilly nearing the finish line. Panicking, he sprinted, but it was too late! Tilly won the race. Benny learned that boasting doesnâ€™t lead to success; hard work and perseverance do. Always believe in yourself!"
